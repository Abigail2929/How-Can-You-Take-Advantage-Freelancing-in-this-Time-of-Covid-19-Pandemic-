The unexpected strike of the COVID-19 not only in the Philippines but in the whole world caused a tremendous number of closing of businesses and job loss that ends to the family's breadwinners or the blue-collar workers to seek jobs online and do freelancing.


But, how can a freelancer use this adverse situation and be uplifted in the industry of freelancing? 


These are some helpful tips from FVA Business Consultancy on taking advantage of this  condition and boost your freelancing career:


1. Learn a new skill in freelancing
Learning a new skill is the most productive thing that you need to do in this pandemic. You learn something new while staying at home with your family. You can watch tutorial videos on YouTube and vlogs or you can enroll in any credible online courses available.


2. Update your online portfolios
Since you are staying at home and you have a lot of extra time, why not get busy updating your portfolio. You need to update your portfolio because freelancing nowadays is portfolio-based and many of the clients are basing their hiring decision on your portfolio. 


3. Be a blessing to your clients
Because of the pandemic virus, many companies are closing and your client’s business might close too. What you can do to help your client is by offering your client to lower your rate or offer a free service.  Your client will appreciate that and the client will trust you more. 


4. Get Organized as a Freelancer
Take advantage of this pandemic crisis by organizing things. This is the best time if you need something to finish or organize your stuff like work station, freelancing folders or notes, and the like. With this, you can work more productive and coordinated.


4. Make us of the Lead Generation
If you lose a client during this pandemic crisis, don’t worry there are still clients out there waiting for your service. Even though a lot of businesses are shutting down, there are still businesses that are still operating online such as consultancy businesses, online services, etc. So, optimize your social media accounts for the client to see and reach you.
